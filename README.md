# Alien invasion

## About
This repository contains an instance of the famous "Space Invaders" arcade game. This project follows almost exactly the instructions found in the book "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition" by Eric Matthes.

## Dependencies
This game uses the module [PyGame] (https://www.pygame.org). It's a super useful package for python for constructing simple games like this.

## Playing the Game
You can run your game through the terminal/command line. If you have python 3 installed on your computer and in your global PATH environment, just execute the command `python alien_invasion.py`in your terminal/command line. If it doesn't work, try using `python3 alien_invasion.py` instead.

## Status of the Project
In construction.
